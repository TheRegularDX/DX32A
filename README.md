# DX32A DELUXE
This is the base DX32 model. The DX32A DELUXE is a custom development board based on the Espressif ESP32S3 N16R8 WiFi and Bluetooth module. designed to be simple and breadboard compatible

## Features
- WiFi and BLE
- x25 GPIO pins
- x1 WS2812B addresable RGB led
- x1 MicroSD card reader


## PlatformIO support
Ive added to this repo a slightly modified version of the official S3 DevKitC .json file to this repo, drag and drop it into `.platformio/platforms/espressif32/boards` to add the DX32 to the PlatformIO boards selector, this can also be used with any other board based on the ESP32S3 N16R8

## Faq
>why it name delucks?

just because i think deluxe is a cool word in general.


## Name change
As of 31/3/24 this board has been renamed to just "DELUXE" instead of "DELUXE Mini", the latter will be reused for a future board
